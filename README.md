# Cart Pole training with Q-learning and different discretizations and metrics t identify best discretizations

## Structure
- `main.py`: python file to start the cart pole training or run with preexisting q-table
- `Cart_Pole.py`: cart pole simulation wich earns with q-learning
- `run_python.sh`: bash script for running different cases after another
- `tests/`: directory of test cases
- `logs/`: output directory for logs

## Training

```sh
    python main.py -t 
```

## Running with preexisting q-table

```sh
    python miani.py -r "Q_table0_Z10L0G0.npy"
```
